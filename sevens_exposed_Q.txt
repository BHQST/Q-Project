Ana and graham of the two and five
ana and graham are the will to survive
ana and graham will run down the kills
ana and graham live in the hard drives
as they approach the end of the cliff,
they take a bow and leap from the edge
only the sky, by the moon is lit,
will bear witness to their final pledge.
ana and graham by there tangled web,
entwined by the lives that their souls hath need. 
the spiders come out and weave up the dead,
god can look down and mourn while he weeps.
ana and graham and all they opposed,
shall fall silent as they decompose
the cicadas will sing as so it is composed
and the cicadas shall ensure the sevens exopsed.

ana and graham expose the sevens and opposed the heavens
ana and graham revealed the omega and concealed the stego
ana and graham knew their demise before the apprise
ana and graham told the cicada to reveal the sevens without
asking questions.
because when the devil curses our revel
then sevens split, as luck would have it

website changed up hard and theres a message for ana

ana there will come a time when you will decide between
yourself and you loved ones. when it comes,  walk the path your
peers would not, triumph in the victory you feel in your
heart. a cab cede ether summer fruit. a bash steg mr hammer
prate. weighted jetport moth.
